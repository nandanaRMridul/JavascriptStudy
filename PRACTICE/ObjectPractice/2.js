const dateEntries = [
  { id: 1, date: "2023-11-15" },
  { id: 2, date: "2023-10-28" },

// Create an object where the key is the id of the earliest date, and the value is the date string.
// Expected output example: { 4: "2023-10-20" }
// Write the javascript code to fulfill the requirement.


//To compare dates effectively, you'll need to convert the date strings in your dateEntries array into Date objects.
//You can create a Date object from a date string like this: new Date("2023-11-15").
//Once you have Date objects, you can compare them using comparison operators (<, >, <=, >=).

//Start by assuming the first entry in your dateEntries array has the earliest date.
//Store the id and the Date object equivalent of the date string from the first entry.
